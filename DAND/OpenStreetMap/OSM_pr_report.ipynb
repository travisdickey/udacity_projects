    "- Lack of Standard Data:\n",
    "    - Large portion of tags created by Tiger GPS and GNIS, which take quite different formats from the standard entries. For example, in this dataset, 13,569 zip codes were entered by Tiger vs. 514 by standard entry.\n",
    "    - Incomplete data. For example, a query for types of 'cuisine' revealed just four seafood restaurants. This is a coastal region. There are most definitely more than four seafood restaurants.\n",
    "    - Very few standard entries reference the county in which a tag occurs, making comparisons by county quite difficult. For example, Effingham County, where I grew up, contains 47 distinct entries, 46 of those were imported from GNIS."
